Hadoop Exercise to Create an Inverted Index

‚Ä¢ Creating an Inverted Index of words occurring in a set of web pages

Objectives:

‚Ä¢ Get hands-on experience in GCP App Engine

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
We‚Äôll be using a subset of 74 files from a total of 408 files (text extracted from HTML tags) derived from the Stanford WebBase project that is available here. It was obtained from a web crawl done in February 2007. It is one of the largest collections totaling more than 100 million web pages from more than 50,000 websites. This version has been cleaned for the purpose of this assignment.

These files will be placed in a bucket on your Google cloud storage and the Hadoop job will be instructed to read the input from this bucket.

1. Uploading the input data into the bucket

a. Get the data files from either of the links below http://www-scf.usc.edu/~csci572/2020Spring/hw3/DATA.zip

https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1Z4KyalIuddPGVkIm6dUjkpD_FiXyNIcq

You may use your USC account to get access to the data from the Google Drive link. Compressed full data is around 1.1GB. Uncompressed, it is 3.12 GB of data for the files for this project. So on balance you should download the zipped file, not the folder.

<ol start="2">
<li>Unzip the contents. You will find two folders inside named ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô and ‚Äòfull data‚Äô. Each of the folders contains the actual data (txt files). We suggest you use the development data initially while you are testing your code. Using the full data will take up to few minutes for each run of the Map-Reduce job and you may risk spending all your cloud credits while testing the code.</li>
<li>Click on ‚ÄòDataproc‚Äô in the left navigation menu under . Next, locate the address of the default Google cloud storage staging bucket for your cluster in the Figure 1 below. If you‚Äôve previously disabled billing, you need to re-enable it before you can upload the data. Refer to the ‚ÄúEnable and Disable Billing account‚Äù section to see how to do this.</li>

e. Go to the storage section in the left navigation bar and select your cluster‚Äôs default bucket from the list of buckets. At the top you should see menu items UPLOAD FILES, UPLOAD FOLDER, CREATE FOLDER, etc (Figure 2). Click on the UPLOAD FOLDER button and upload the dev_data folder and full_data folder individually. This will take a while, but there will be a progress bar (Figure 3). You may not see this progress bar as soon as you start the upload but, it will show up eventually.

Inverted Index Implementation using Map-Reduce

Now that you have the cluster and the files in place, you need to write the actual code for the job. As of now, Google Cloud allows us to submit jobs via the UI, only if they are packaged as a jar file. The following steps are focused on submitting a job written in Java via the Cloud console UI.

Refer to the examples below and write a Map-Reduce job in java that creates an Inverted Index given a collection of text files. You can very easily tweak a word-count example to create an inverted index instead (Hint: Change the mapper to output word docID instead of word count and in the reducer use a HashMap).

Here are some helpful examples of Map-Reduce Jobs

1. https://developer.yahoo.com/hadoop/tutorial/module4.html#wordcount

2. https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-

core/MapReduceTutorial.html

The example in the following pages explains a Hadoop word count implementation in detail. It takes one text file as input and returns the word count for every word in the file. Refer to the comments in the code for explanation.

The Mapper Class:

The input data is cleaned, that is all the \n\r s is removed but one or more \t might still be present (which needs to be handled). There will be punctuation and you are required to handle this in your code. Replace all the occurrences of special charactersandnumeralsbyspacecharacter,convertallthewordstothelowercase. The‚Äò\t‚Äôseparatesthekey(Document ID) from the value(Document). The input files are in a key value format as below:

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Sample document:

The mapper‚Äôs output is expected to be as follows:

The above example indicates that the word aspect occurred 1 time in the document with docID 5722018411 and economics 2 times.

The reducer takes this as input, aggregates the word counts using a Hashmap and creates the Inverted index. The format of the index is as follows.

word docID:count docID:count docID:count‚Ä¶

The above sample shows a portion of the inverted index created by the reducer.

To write the Hadoop java code you can use the VI or nano editors that come pre-installed on the master node. You can test your code on the cluster itself. Be sure to use the development data while testing the code. You are expected to write a simple Hadoop job. You can just tweak this example if you‚Äôd like, but make sure you understand it first.

Creating a jar for your code

Now that your code for the job is ready we‚Äôll need to run it. The Google Cloud console requires us to upload a Map-Reduce job as a jar file. In the following example the Mapper and Reducer are in the same file called InvertedIndexJob.java.To create a jar for the Java class implemented please follow the instructions below. The following instructions were executed on the cluster‚Äôs master node on the Google Cloud.

1. Say your Java Job file is called InvertedIndex.java. Create a JAR as follows: ‚óã hadoopcom.sun.tools.javac.MainInvertedIndexJob.java

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">

<pre>          Note: InvertedIndexJob.java uses or overrides a deprecated API.
</pre>
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details. ‚óã jarcfinvertedindex.jarInvertedIndex*.class

Now you have a jar file for your job. You need to place this jar file in the default cloud bucket of your cluster. Just create a folder called JAR on your bucket and upload it to that folder. If you created your jar file on the cluster‚Äôs master node itself use the following commands to copy it to the JAR folder.

‚óã hadoopfs-copyFromLocal./invertedindex.jar

‚óã hadoopfs-cp./invertedindex.jargs://dataproc-69070‚Ä¶/JAR

The highlighted part is the default bucket of your cluster. It needs to be prepended by the gs:// to tell the Hadoop environment that it is a bucket and not a regular location on the filesystem.

Note: This is not the only way to package your code into a jar file. You can follow any method that will create a single jar file that can be uploaded to the Google cloud.

Submitting the Hadoop job to your cluster

As mentioned before, a job can be submitted in two ways.

<ol>
<li>From the console‚Äôs UI.</li>
<li>From the command line on the master node.
If you‚Äôd like to submit the job via the command line follow the instructions here https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-
</li>
</ol>
core/MapReduceTutorial.html

Follow the instructions below to submit a job to the cluster via the console‚Äôs UI.

1. Go to the ‚ÄúJobs‚Äù section in the left navigation bar of the Dataproc page and click on ‚ÄúSubmit job‚Äù.

Figure 4: Dataproc jobs section

2. Fill the job parameters as follows (see Figure 13 for reference): ‚óã Cluster: Select the cluster you created

fastest way to get the entries associated with the words. For example to search for ‚Äústring‚Äù use

grep -w ‚Äò^string ‚Äô output_sorted.txt

Note:-&gt; In the above grep command, the word to be searched should be followed by a tab character.

Part II: Inverted Index of Bigrams using Map-Reduce

Now that you are familiar with setting up and running Hadoop jobs on GCP, you will now modify your InvertedIndexJob.java script to generate an inverted index of bigrams (instead of unigrams).

Your existing Mapper class emits (word, docID) pairs which are then aggregated in the Reducer class. You will have to modify your Mapper class to emit (‚Äúword1 word2‚Äù, docID) pairs instead. The reducer remains unchanged.

Once you modify your class(es), create the jar invertedindex__bigrams.jar and dispatch a Hadoop job on the devdata/ in the same manner as before.

The output will look something like this:

To get credit for this task, create another text file index_bigrams.txt with the index entries for the following bigram phrases (generated from devdata/):

<ol>
<li>computer science</li>
<li>information retrieval</li>
<li>power politics</li>
<li>los angeles</li>
<li>bruce willis</li>
</ol>
You can apply grep on the output file in the same way you did for the previous exercises.

FAQ:

Q) Can‚Äôt seem to select a cluster for submitting a job? A) Changing the region will do the trick

Q) How many files were there in full_data while uploading? A) You need to upload .txt files only !!

Number of .txt files is 74.

Q) Chrome suffers, in uploading 74 files?

A) Consider opening the storage in another tab and checking the number of files. This way you will be able to know when the upload is complete.

Q) Do we have to use Java as the programming language?

A) Please go ahead and use any language binding of your choice.

Note : You may be on your own with language other than Java. TA‚Äôs may not be able to help with other languages.

Q) How to Import and Export Java Projects as JAR Files in Eclipse?

A) http://www.albany.edu/faculty/jmower/geog/gog692/ImportExportJARFiles.htm

Q) Is it fine to submit only one .Java file, which has the all the (Mapper and Reducer Classes) inside it ? A) One .java file containing your entire program should be good enough.

Q) Approximately how long does it take for a submitted job to finish in GCloud Dataproc? A) It takes approximately 10 minutes

Q) Should the postings list be in the sorted order of docIDs? A) No need to sort the listings.

Q) Google cloud is not allowing to ssh? A) You need to start VMs manually.

Q) Where can I find log files?

A) Cloud Dataproc -&gt; Under Jobs

Click on one of the jobs you ran.

Q) Should identical words in different case be treated as same or different words?

A) Different words, you need not pre-process or case fold.

Q) How to check number of files in full_data on storage bucket?

A) Go to your bucket, select the full_data folder and click on delete. It‚Äôll list out the total files present. DO NOT PRESS DELETE in the dialog box that appears. Or run the following command from the hadoop cluster terminal:

Hadoop fs -find gs://‚Ä¶//full_data/*.txt | wc -l

You can perform certain sanity checks.

1) Check if your code run properly for the dev_data?

2) Check if you used correct space / tab specifications as mentioned in the assignment description, sometimes it might be the problem with the storage space related to that.

3) You can debug with a single custom file to see, if everything is properly indexed or not.

Q) Different index order. Should we take the same index order (sorted) or can it be different (unsorted)?

A) Order does not matter. The accuracy of results is important.

Q) Code runs fine on development but strange file size with full data.

A) Check if the results produced by running on dev_data produces huge file sizes as well. If so, that means you have to check your code. If not, check if your full_data is uploaded correctly.

Q) I‚Äôm getting this error repeatedly, but I‚Äôve already created the output directory and have set the argument path to that directory. Can someone help me with it?

A) You need to delete the output folder because the driver will attempt to create the output folder based on the argument provided.

Q) Am able to run the dev_data and it is generating results. But if I ran the same code on the full data I am getting an error. The job is running for till map 25% and then it throws an error?

A) Please check that you have all the files uploaded just fine, and you should have 74 files in full_data.

Q) Starting VM instance failed

When I try to start the VM instances, for some of them it shows the message: Error: Quota ‚ÄúCPUS‚Äù exceeded: Limit 8.0?

A) If you get an error saying that you‚Äôve exceeded your quota, reduce the number of worker nodes or choose a Machine Type(for master and worker) with fewer vCPUs.

Q) Error enabling DataProc API

A) shut down project and create new one

Q) No space between DocID:count pairs in the output file after merge?

Important Points:

#P1) Output folder Number of parts generated ‚Äì can be any number

#P2) Manually inspect output.txt and copy lines for the words from it and create a new txt file named index.txt. ‚Äì for the 8 words

#P3) start worker nodes before submitting job to cluster

#P4) No Sysout ‚Äì write in logs from reduce function

#P5) jar tvf jar_file_name ‚Äì to list class files archived for a jar

#P6) space in your folder name which is treated as illegal character ‚Äì throws error

#P7) Every time you disable billing and enable billing, you need to start VMs manually.

#P8) If you are not able to upload full data then add the data in parts. The main aim is to get all the files there.

#P9) Size of output folder for full data can vary.

#P10) When using ‚Äúgrep‚Äù command to search for keywords, look for exact match.

#P11) You just disable the billing account (when you‚Äôre not using it) as per mentioned in the HW description. There‚Äôs no need to disable the cluster, they‚Äôll not charge you. Also, when you‚Äôll disable the billing account; your master and worker threads will be disabled automatically.

#P12) You have to write a program that outputs the entire inverted index file and then using the grep command filter out the indices of the eight words given
